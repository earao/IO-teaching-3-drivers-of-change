# 3. Understanding drivers of change

## Input-output video 5: Understanding drivers of difference using Structural Decomposition Analysis (11 mins)

This video introduces the concept of understanding drivers of difference and structural decomposition analysis.

One of the main uses of input-output analysis is to calculate consumption-based accounts.
